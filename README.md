The Socket Server TCP/UDP Programming project offers a comprehensive suite of examples showcasing the creation of socket servers using both the TCP and UDP protocols, addressing everything from foundational client-server communication models to more advanced setups like peer-to-peer connections and concurrent servers. It features reliable, connection-oriented TCP servers that can handle multiple clients with echo or chat functions, and lightweight, connectionless UDP servers for fast, message-based exchanges and broadcast applications. The repository also provides implementations that demonstrate handling multiple clients simultaneously through multithreading or multiprocessing, as well as dedicated TCP and UDP clients for testing purposes. To facilitate a deeper understanding, it includes practical examples of network broadcasting and peer-to-peer interactions, along with extensive notes and clear usage instructions for compiling and running each example on major operating systems. This resource is ideal for learning and teaching core computer networking concepts, developing scalable networked applications, and experimenting with both robust (TCP) and high-speed (UDP) data transmission methods.
